# OSHO Gourishankar Meditation Flickering Light Program

## Introduction
This program is designed to facilitate the second stage of the OSHO Gourishankar Meditation by providing a flickering light emitted from the terminal emulator at a frequency of 490 beats per minute (bpm). The purpose of this flickering light is to aid in achieving the meditative state described in the OSHO Gourishankar Meditation technique.

## Purpose of the Flickering Light
During the second stage of the meditation, participants are instructed to return to normal breathing and with a gentle gaze, look at a flashing blue light. This stage aims to help participants reach a deeper level of meditation through the use of visual stimuli. The flickering light from this program is designed to synchronize with the rhythmic beat that is seven times the normal heartbeat, as mentioned in the meditation's guidelines. This synchronization helps in enhancing the meditative experience, making it possible to achieve the intended "high" state, akin to feeling as high as Gourishankar, Mt. Everest.

## Usage
1. Ensure your terminal emulator is capable of running C++ programs.
2. Execute the program before starting the second stage of the OSHO Gourishankar Meditation.
3. Position yourself comfortably in front of the terminal emulator where the flickering light is visible.
4. Start the meditation and proceed with the second stage, focusing gently on the flickering light.

## Warning
- **Health Precaution**: Individuals with a neurological disorder, such as epilepsy, should **not** use strobe or flashing lights for this meditation due to the risk of triggering seizures. As an alternative, these individuals can use a blindfold during the second stage of the meditation.

## Note
- This program is specifically designed for the second stage of the OSHO Gourishankar Meditation. It is important to follow the meditation's stages as prescribed for the full experience.
- The meditation lasts one hour and transitions through four stages, concluding with three gong beats.

We hope this program enhances your meditative practice by providing a tool that aligns with the OSHO Gourishankar Meditation's guidelines. Remember to meditate responsibly and be mindful of your health and safety while using this program.
